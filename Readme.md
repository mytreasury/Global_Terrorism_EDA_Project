### Project Summary
My project name is Global Terrorism. This data is available from 1970 to 2017. 
I find that this is a very use the full project for all countries because the terrorist activity is happening everywhere. 
First, we download the data and import all libraries which will use in making grapes. 

I read the graph and find the all null value and which null values there in the column we replace and some columns are having a more null values.
 I remove the column and take only which column is used fully for analyzing data. I changed the column name.

First plot

I use the count plot to find which types of weapons they are using.

second plot

This plot I used from 1970 to 2017 that year how many terrorist attacks happen.

Third plot

This plot I used for which moth the terrorist activity happening.

Fourth plot

This plot is showing which terrorist organization is very strong.

Fifth plot

This plot is showing several attacks happening in which region mostly.

Six plot

This plot is showing which types of terrorist attacks happened 


On that plot, I analyzed the terrorist activity.

### solution to Business bojective

This project will help to county defense system as well as which companies make weapons or defense security providing it will be used fully because they can make this type of weapon or security system.


In that,

 I found out which types of weapons we have to make explosives types of weapons we have to make.

The second thing is from 2014 to 2017 terrorist activity is increasing because of technology is increasing so we have to work on our technology 


Third, we can Taliban is are very strong terrorist organization so how can we keep watch on that I have to make this type of communication system.


which country or region very suffering from this terrorist activity we can make the weapons or defense system for this country.


### Conclusion

My conclusion from that project is we have to focus on new technology because terrorists are using the most dangerous weapons. We find at 2014 most terrorist activity happened because weapons are made powerfully full 
my conclusion we have to make a powerful full defense system. In that Talibanisam this terrorist organization is very powerful full we have to keep watch on all activity .weston Europe region most terrorist activity happening we have to protect that.
